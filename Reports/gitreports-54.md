I am a resident of chatri hall. In my 1-2 and 2-1 days, the roommate seniors from 15 batch were unnecessarily rude to me and especially to my friends. For studies and group projects my classmates needed to come to my room, but most of the time they shouted on them and scolded them mostly for no reason. For example, one day i was solving maths with a friend of mine during pl. Even though we were discussing quitely one of them scolded my friend so badly that we left the room, we were so scared of them that my friends used to meet me outside the room whenever they needed me. Those incidents hurt us mentally and hampered our study works. Though these things are too mild compared to things that happen in other halls but mental health is also a big concern i guess.
