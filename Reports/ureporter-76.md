Arif Rayhan Dip, 09 Batch
I immediately recognize BAL brown nosers whenever I see someone crying over Dip's death. They call him Martyr, sigh. His death was an act of terror, but the relief every nonpolitical student felt when he was put to coma far outweighs the fear of fundamentalism anyone felt. In contrast, his reign over the campus was of pure terror, every other day was either harassing some girl or beating up some person. In a twisted way, he was also a terrorist. A true psychopath resulting from a dysfunctional family. If he were alive, he would have eventually ended up killing someone, no one had any doubt. May he , infinitely, over and over, experience the trauma he has bestowed over others in his short earthly life.
