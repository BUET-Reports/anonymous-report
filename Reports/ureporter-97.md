When I was a student in 3rd year (3-2), my immediate senior batch was the 'rag' batch or the graduating batch. This was in June or July, 2014.  It was the first day of 3-2 term and my friends and I were heading towards the cafe during a break between two classes. The rag corner was crowded with few of the rag students (09 batch)- some of the names are Azim, Sion, Limon. They halted us and started over reacting, aggressively  that why would i try to enter the cafe from this gate. I explained to him that due to rain the other gate was flooded and I couldn't use any other gate . They started getting aggressive and I asked them- trying to be calm- what is the reason i cant enter the cafe using this gate. They got even more aggressive- started screaming-কোন ব্যাচ ’১০ ব্যাচ? আমি কোন ব্যাচ জানো? বুয়েটে তো অনেক দিন হল- কোন নিয়ম কানুন জানো না??? তোর বাপ কে? কে তোর বাপ? তুই আর্কির?” মা*** তোকে মাটিতে পুতে ফেলবো। তুই অ্যারোগেন্স দ্যাখাস? সিনিয়রদের সাথে কথা বলতে হয় কীভাবে জানিশ না? We were asked to apologize and leave. I denied to apologize and they threatened my male friend who was with me, that they will beat him up and break his leg that evening. I eventually went back- that night I called our then DSW to complain about this issue. He responded that "কি করবো, কথা শনে নাহ, অবাধ্য ছেলে। তুমি ক্যাফেটেরিয়া আভয়িড করে চল এখন থেকে। Getting no justice from the authority I shared this with my peers, seniors juniors etc. I was asked not to escalate this issue in the fear that - তুমি একা চলা ফেরা কর, বঝই তহ। I never got closure.
