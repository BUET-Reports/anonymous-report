Don't forget the reason Fahad died. He died for protesting Indian imperialism. Besides banning student politics, a point as to the termination of India Bangladesh agreement lately should be included in the demands.
Don't let Fahad's death turn out to be a futile case. 
Best wishes for the next endeavors.
