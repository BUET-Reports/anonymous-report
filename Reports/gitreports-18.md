Received death threat from my own batchmate (10 batch) BCL goons for speaking up against the heinous activities of BCL in the country. They picked me up from my hall room at 1 AM and released me at 2.30 AM. The faces that I remember are: Afzal khan, Abu Sayeed Konok, Jaminur, Saminur, Soumya and many more that I don't remember.
