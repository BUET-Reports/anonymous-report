Computer Science and Engineering department of BUET recently started a review system of teachers where student can rate their teachers and comment on their teachers' performance anonymously. But despite getting bad reviews, teachers do not seem to change their methods of teaching. Though sometimes the teachers are asked to take alternate courses after negative reviews, they still do not improve, in some case even worse than before. So the authority should take necessary steps to ensure the effectiveness of the review system.
