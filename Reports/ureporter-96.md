there is a version of departmental rag which is also done in this university. specially in ChE‚WRE‚NAME‚MME. from the very first day‚this type of rag starts in the name of 'porichitiporbo'. and later continues up to reception. on the reception night‚stage rag is also given. and seniors from rag batch to immediate celebrates it. and the teachers allow it and they leave the room before this to give control. 
imagine what a student goes through when he first arrives on his first day and experience this. though it is mild rag compared to what happens in halls. but it should also be stopped.
