No, I’m not a Buetian. But I’m here to tell you how your campus’s impression changed within a day to me. The terror that those beasts gave birth to. I was in love with Buet until today, I’m a NSUer. But, I come to DU and BUET often to witness some short pitch cricket there. Buet felt like a little dream, I used to relate with 3 idiots. Every scene from there. 3 idiots missed out on what actually happens in there. From that day, my father doesn’t tell my younger brother that he has to be an engineer from a public university. I worry about him, I worry my brother ‘might make it to Buet somehow’ but I promise even if he does, I will be able to walk on everyone’s decision and pay for my brother’s education. Atleast he will live. Please take care, please don’t let anyone from you people die. Please.
