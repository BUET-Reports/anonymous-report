problems: 1.Classes are not interesting or clear enough to keep the focus on for a longer period  2.Too much non-dept courses 3. People are less interactive 4.Intense psychological issues 5.Teachers are not that much interactive and promoting. Most of the focus are always on roll 1,2,3,4  6.Focus on hardware is more than what is on software. 0.75 credit Algorithm sessional and 1.5 credit DEPT sessional? That's ridiculous. 7.Too much EEE courses. Algorithm and DS course should be 4 credit. 8.Most of the courses are less ""problem solving"" based.Less application based. 9.Term final questions are rather more descriptive than needing critical thinking. Most of the time it's hard to finish in time.So study patter becomes for memorization based, which many of us can't adapt to.
 
solutions: 1.More interaction needed from all parties. 2.Point of application must be clearly made.Courses needs to be more based on solving ""new instance"".  3.Psychological aid needs to be ensured. 4.Collection of Course materials must be centrally handled. 5.Term final question pattern must change. It needs to be more critical thinking based, rather than being lengthy."
