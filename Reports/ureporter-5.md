One day, about 1 year ago I was doing a project with my group mates and it got late. So I decided to stay at Chhatri Hall that night. I went there at 9:00 pm. They did not let me in saying that there was that new rule, "students must apply 7days before the night they stay at hall". I requested them a lot. But they left me with one option and that was I had to come home alone grabbing a local bus at 10:00 pm.
